# AI-based Cultural Heritage Identification System

Our Artificial Intelligence project is devoted to the preservation of Indonesian culture. Through this initiative, we strive to assist individuals in identifying physical objects that represent Indonesia's rich heritage. As society advances, it is essential to ensure that this culture is not lost or forgotten.
